        <h1>Meet Barbara</h1>

       <p>My story begins Christmas, 1987. A newlywed, trying to make ends meet, holiday spending had to be on a budget. I have always enjoyed baking so I thought why not make homemade sweets as holiday gifts for friends and family?? As family and friends enjoyed the sweets, they would all make the comment “These sweets are homemade by Barbara!” Thus, Homemade By Barbara was born. The following Christmas and pretty much every Christmas since I have been told to make sure I bring the sweets!</p>

        <p>Today, I bring the sweets to all of you through modern technology and this amazing website created by my son in law as a Christmas gift. God never ceases to amaze me through the plans he has for me (Jeremiah 29:11). On this website you you will find stories, blogs, pictures and information on how to order the goodies you see.</p>
